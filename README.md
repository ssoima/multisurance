# multisurance
Multisurance is a 3rd party service provider Manager for insurances.

####What is multisurance now?
Insured Customers with a Law Insurance have a portal where they can upload their Service Description and Cost plans.
In case that the services have been facilitated, the lawyer can confirm this digitally.

####What could multisurance be?
* Recommendation system for redirecting customers from 3rd party services to services from partner providers: 
  * Whenever a claim is submitted by a customer, the software analyzes the submitted data, understands the service requested via an AI Model and searches for an appropiate alternative service from a preferred service provider. In the end, the customer gets a recommendation of a better (and cheaper) service ( therefore creating win-win situation) 
* Insured Customers have a portal for managing their claims. This portal offers:
  * Service discovery: like on urbansportsclub, insured people can search for services/facilities through filters and on a map
  * Digital submission of service requests via QR codes with the preferred service providers
* Insurances get a portal for working with 3rd party service providers. Additionally, it facilitates:
  * recommending new profitable partnerships with service providers
  * identifying unprofitable partnerships
  * offering an instant service covering forecast => helping the service provider to sell the service (as there are no doubts from the insured person's side)
* By having a good communication interface with the insured customers as well as service providers, the software intelligence can recommend the right service for solving the client's issue in a cost-effective way. By doing this autonomously the customer is not bound to any service times and can solve his problem right away after the first touchpoint. The insurer therefore reduces the risk of the customer trying to solve his problem through other channels.

####What is the most tricky part from a technological standpoint?
Autonomously understanding the issue of the customer with a high reliability and mapping this to services. However, I believe a GPT3-based solution should be able to do this.
